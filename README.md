# Simple React Invoice

This is a simple application where a user is able to create an Invoice. The user is able to select from a drop down of items, triggering a GET request from an API, and add the selected item to a table of items. The user is then able to click the pay now button which triggers a POST request and sends the table of selected items to the Fattmerchant OMNI API.
